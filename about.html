    <h1>On this Hill,</h1>
    <p class="center">We strive to make the customer happy, regardless of whom they are. We don't turn anyone away, and everyone is welcome. While I don't know why one would randomly come to us and not want to get any food, this certainly could happen, and we would still invite you inside. We hope you enjoy our restaurant.</p>
    <h6>Note: This does not mean that one does not need to behave. Everyone is expected to behave while in this restaurant and if you are causing a disturbance, we will require you to move or leave.</h6>
